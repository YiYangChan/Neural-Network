# Neural-Network

As a beginner of deep learning. I tried to create some simple neural networks to learn the principles and ideas of deep learning and use neural networks to train some simple projects. Now I'm working on learning how to use Python (I've been a programmer using C/C++ before) and trying to build a neural network that recognizes hand-written numbers.
